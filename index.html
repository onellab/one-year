        <p> I am so madly in love with you that it terrifies me because I cannot even fathom my life without you for a life without isn't worth living. </p>

        <p> You saw something in me I still don't see to this day but never a day goes by where I don't thank the universe that you do. I promise to never take you or us for granted. I love you and everything that you stand for with all my heart. Today and forever. </p>

    <div class="paper image" >
        <p> You make me want to be a better person and although I know I am failing please know that I am trying because if I don't I would never ever deserve you. You are my everything, my andromeda. </p>

        <p> If I said that perfection was impossible, meeting you would mean I lie because only if you are God's favourite child do you meet intelligence incarnate who can not only effortlessly be funny and caring and oh so handsome but do so with the deepest dive worthy dimples. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper image" >
        <p>I thought perfection was an impossibile illusion until I saw you walking towards me that day, until I felt your lips on mine and your touch on my bare back, until I felt your warm embrace...until I experienced domesticity with you. </p>
